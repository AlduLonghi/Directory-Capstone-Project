# Directory-Capstone-Project

This project consists of recreating with your own content a School Directory sample page. I had to recreate the homepage as well as the search results page and the school information page. The aim of this is to show you have mastered the concepts from this HTML/CSS curriculum. This means Flexbox, Grid, embeding images and videos, etc.

In this project:

1. I took a mobile first approach in styling the page ensuring it work for all screen sizes.
2. Flex and grid properties were used for the page layout using the bootstrap v4.5 framework and I used Sass as a pre-processor.
